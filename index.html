    var formattedBody = `Dear Mayor Cutter and Police Chief Tudor:
    \nMy name is [insert name]. I am a resident of [State/City] and I am contacting you in response to the murder of Steven Taylor at the hands of SLPD.
    \n I am frustrated with our city leadership for not responding to this matter publicly, despite many opportunities to. I am frustrated with our city for not contacting Mr. Taylor’s family to offer support or condolences. I am frustrated that the police officer responsible for his murder has not yet been named, fired, or charged for this abuse of power. I demand that justice be served for Steven and his family. I demand that you investigate this murder thoroughly, and that you place pressure on the county and state officials to investigate as well. I demand that a public statement be made to not only honor Steven’s life, but to serve as a public platform to declare that black lives matter in San Leandro; to declare the black mental health matters in San Leandro; to declare that Steven Taylor’s life mattered and was taken unlawfully.
    \n In addition, I demand that we provide more support for community efforts and organizations that work to prevent police brutality and violence.
    \n Thank you for your time,
    \n[insert name]
